[Current build](https://csshacks.vercel.app/)

#### Features

- Responsive support for viewports across different device types (desktops, tablets, phones)
- A gallery with a carousel is implemented using a CSS hack with a modified form
- Partial reverse engineering of the carousel has been done, with functional descriptions of different code blocks in the comments
- The carousel supports keyboard navigation
- For small tablets and phones, the main menu switches to a minimized emoji version
- Text descriptions on the main page are responsively shortening for small screens
- In the responsive table, degradation for small resolutions is implemented: one column disappears completely, and in some others, the description is simplified to save space
